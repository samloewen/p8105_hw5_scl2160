The control group consistantly had lower scores than the experimental
group. The experimental group seemed to score higher over time, whereas
the control group stayed relatively level.

When we look at all cases, the sample average of β1 is appoximately
equal to the true value of β1. However when we filter for cases in which
the null hypothesis is rejected, the β1s are no longer equal. Our
estiamted and true values are less similar in the second plot because we
are filtering for cases where we would reject the null hypothesis, or
cases where our outcome is significantly different from our expected
value.
